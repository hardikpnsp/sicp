# SICP

>It does not matter much what the programs are about of what applications they serve. What does matter is how well they perform and how smoothly they fit with other programs in the creation of still greater programs. The programmer must seek both perfection of part and adequacy of collection.

In this repo I write solutions and comments for the exercises given in the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

## Structure and interpretation of the repository

### Chapter 1 and 2

- Every exercise till chapter 2 is written in `.scm` files
- I have used [MIT Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) as a lisp dialect and [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) as an editor
- I found this article - [Don't Panic!](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/dont-panic/) - really helpful for initial setup
